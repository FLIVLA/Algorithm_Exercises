BUBBLE-SORT
---------------------------------------------------------
simple comparison based sorting algorithm. NOT efficient
for large datasets.

useful in scenarios below:
- simplicity and easy implementation. 
- Nearly sorted or small datasets.
- Learning to understand sorting algorithms.

When using this, the datastructure to be sorted, will most
likely be an array or a list.

Guess it's not that useful afterall?
